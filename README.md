# getdata_project
This repository contains materials for my Getting and Cleaning Data course project.

run_analysis.R does the following:

* reads in some data collected by the smartphones of 30 people 
* analyzes that data
* writes out a summary as a text file named project_final.txt.  

CodeBook.md describes what is in that text file.
